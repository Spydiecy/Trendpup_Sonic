## Our Memecoin Analysis Methodology

**TrendPup's AI-Powered Fundamental Analysis Framework**

Our system employs a comprehensive **5-Factor Risk Assessment Model** that prioritizes capital preservation while identifying legitimate opportunities. Here's how we analyze every memecoin:

### üö® Critical Risk Factors We Assess

**1. LIQUIDITY HEALTH** üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Pool Size Analysis**: Tokens with <$50K liquidity flagged as HIGH RISK
- **Slippage Risk Assessment**: Low liquidity = difficulty selling without major price impact
- **Exit Strategy Viability**: Can you actually get your money out?
- **Volume-to-Liquidity Ratio**: High ratios (>5x) suggest potential manipulation

**2. AGE-BASED SECURITY** ‚è∞
- **Brand New (<24 hours)**: EXTREME RUG PULL RISK
- **Very New (<7 days)**: HIGH RISK - most rug pulls occur in this phase
- **Young (<30 days)**: MODERATE RISK - still establishing legitimacy
- **Established (>90 days)**: LOWER RISK - survived initial high-risk phases

**3. VOLATILITY PATTERNS** üìàüìâ
- **Extreme Volatility (>100% daily)**: Possible pump/dump scheme indicators
- **Manipulation Detection**: Sudden coordinated price movements
- **Healthy Volatility Range**: 20-50% daily for memecoins is normal
- **Technical Analysis**: Support/resistance level identification

**4. CONTRACT SECURITY** üîí
- **Ownership Status**: Renounced contracts provide higher security
- **Hidden Functions**: Detection of honeypot, pause, or blacklist capabilities
- **Mint Authority**: Analysis of unlimited token creation risks
- **Audit Status**: Third-party security review verification

**5. COMMUNITY AUTHENTICITY** üë•
- **Real Twitter Activity Analysis**: Direct scraping and analysis of actual tweets using $TOKEN searches
- **Engagement Quality Assessment**: Likes, retweets, and replies analysis for authenticity
- **Organic Growth Verification**: Real engagement vs. bot activity detection through tweet patterns
- **Developer Transparency**: Public team vs. anonymous developer assessment
- **Advanced Sentiment Scoring**: AI-powered analysis of tweet content sentiment and market mood
- **Holder Distribution**: Concentration risk in few wallets
- **Community Activity Levels**: High (5+ tweets), Medium (2-5 tweets), Low (<2 tweets)

### üìä Risk Assessment Framework

**Risk Levels (1-10 Scale):**
- **1-3: LOW RISK** - Established tokens with solid fundamentals
- **4-6: MEDIUM RISK** - Some concerns but manageable with proper position sizing
- **7-8: HIGH RISK** - Multiple red flags, very small positions only
- **9-10: EXTREME RISK** - Avoid entirely or exit immediately

**Potential Levels (1-10 Scale):**
- **8-10: HIGH POTENTIAL** - Strong fundamentals + compelling narrative + authentic community
- **5-7: MEDIUM POTENTIAL** - Some positive factors with moderate upside
- **1-4: LOW POTENTIAL** - Limited catalysts or declining metrics

### üõ°Ô∏è Position Sizing Recommendations

Our AI provides specific portfolio allocation guidance:
- **Low Risk (1-3)**: Up to 5-10% of portfolio allocation
- **Medium Risk (4-6)**: 2-5% of portfolio maximum
- **High Risk (7-8)**: 1-2% of portfolio maximum
- **Extreme Risk (9-10)**: Avoid entirely or <1% speculation only

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automatic Red Flag Detection

Our system immediately warns users about:
- Zero or unknown liquidity data
- Daily price changes exceeding 200%
- Unverified or suspicious contract information
- Anonymous teams making unrealistic promises
- Sudden coordinated social media campaign patterns

### üéØ Investment Philosophy

**Capital Preservation First**: We prioritize avoiding total loss over chasing maximum gains. Our philosophy: "Better to miss a 10x than lose everything on a rug pull."

**Our Analysis Helps Users:**
- Avoid total loss scenarios through comprehensive risk assessment
- Size positions appropriately based on individual risk profiles
- Identify genuine opportunities with long-term staying power
- Plan exit strategies before entering positions
- Make data-driven decisions rather than emotional trades

## How It Improves the Status Quo

Traditional memecoin research methods have major limitations:
